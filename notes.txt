HERE ARE MY NOTES:

In order to use most requests, you first need to use the getLegislators method in order to retrieve each legislators' CID
(canadite identifcation number).

So the way I'm thinking about currently going about this right now, 
// is when I search up a name, the searchedName should 1. ACESS THE CID from a SQL table, 2. Implement that CID into a POST query
// The options from a drop down menu should control the actual Open Secrets API method I call at that time.
